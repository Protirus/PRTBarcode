## Protirus Asset Management Barcode Solution

Protirus have developed an App for iOS and Android phones that allows your current asset information to be manipulated in an easy, user friendly manner extending your Altiris investment  by negating the need to manually enter asset information.

If you are struggling to locate your assets throughout your organisation this App can be used with your Altiris product set, matching vendor bar codes with locations and users. The App is extremely intuitive and can be used with little to no training.

The benefits are that this drives value out of your Altiris investment even if you already have a good asset process by preventing the need to manually enter assets and location information.

Protirus spent a long time with customers finding out exactly what they wanted to do, as a result we have developed the key requirements to any asset management lifecycle process.
